# My Portfolio

# Description

The goal of this project was to build a portfolio of my work and to showcase my talents. I gave it a clean, well laid out design using Flexbox that made this portfolio approachable and easy to digest at first glance.

## Approach 

To tackle this portfolio project I relied heavly on CSS flexbox to help me create a responsive layout. Everything on the page should shrink and grow depending on the viewport. It was to have a split layout design so using flex properties I made the titles of the sections take up 25 percent of the page and the main section to take up 75 percent. I felt this was a solid approach and gave me a clean layout that I was looking for. I decided to give my webpage a cool neutral tone layout to help in stand out among the mass of portfolios that exsist on the web.

Once you have done a git clone you are free to start working on this project. If you want to push your changes to my repo then you would have to head into terminal/bash and do a git add . Then a git commit -m explaning the changes made, and finally a git push to push the files onto the repo.
