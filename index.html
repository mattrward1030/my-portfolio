            <p>
                I am an aspiring computer programmer in the early stages of my development. I started this journey
                back
                in October of 2020 in the hopes of finding a career that could support me and my family. I have a
                passion for technology and problem solving, I put those two passions together and decided that computer
                programming was the best option for me.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                At first I took some free courses to see if I had a taste for programming, from there I stepped up
                to a
                course on <a href="https://Udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy.com</a> . I loved what that course had to
                offer but I wanted
                something that would push
                me
                more so I decided to join the UPenn Full Stack Flex program. It has been the best decision I have
                made,
                I am learning so much as well as making connections with my peers, something not offered in my
                other
                online course. I look forward to the many projects i am going to be able to create in this course
                and
                the knowledge I am gaining. Below is some projects that show off my abilities so far!
